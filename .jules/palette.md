## 2024-05-20 - EditBox Focus Management
**Learning:** WoW EditBox components can trap user keyboard input. If `OnEscapePressed` (or `OnEnterPressed`) isn't explicitly handled to call `ClearFocus()`, the user might be stuck or unexpectedly trigger the Game Menu without properly exiting the input field.
**Action:** Always add `OnEscapePressed` (and `OnEnterPressed`) script handlers to `EditBox` components that call `self:ClearFocus()` to ensure a smooth keyboard navigation experience.
## 2025-02-12 - EditBox Keyboard Trapping
**Learning:** In WoW addons, `EditBox` components can trap user keyboard input when hidden via `self:Hide()` if `ClearFocus()` is not explicitly called. This prevents players from using normal game keybinds until they manually click out of the hidden box.
**Action:** Always call `editBox:ClearFocus()` in the `OnEscapePressed` (and `OnEnterPressed`) script handlers of `EditBox` elements, regardless of whether the element is also being hidden.

## 2025-02-27 - EditBox Hidden Trapping Fix
**Learning:** Even when `OnEscapePressed` handles focus clearing correctly, hiding a frame containing an active `EditBox` programmatically (e.g., clicking a 'Close' button or toggle) will keep the text input in focus.
**Action:** Always hook the `OnHide` event of dialogs containing text inputs to clear focus from child `EditBox` elements (`element:ClearFocus()`).
