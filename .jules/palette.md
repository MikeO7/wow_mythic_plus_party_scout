## 2024-05-20 - EditBox Focus Management
**Learning:** WoW EditBox components can trap user keyboard input. If `OnEscapePressed` (or `OnEnterPressed`) isn't explicitly handled to call `ClearFocus()`, the user might be stuck or unexpectedly trigger the Game Menu without properly exiting the input field.
**Action:** Always add `OnEscapePressed` (and `OnEnterPressed`) script handlers to `EditBox` components that call `self:ClearFocus()` to ensure a smooth keyboard navigation experience.
