## 2024-05-19 - String Operation Bottlenecks in LFG List Updates
**Learning:** Functions like `PGF.IsMostLikelySameInstance` that perform heavy string allocations (bracket removal loops, gmatch/gsubs for tokenization) can cause significant UI stuttering when called frequently during frame updates. Since the set of instance names is small and bounded, repeated complex parsing is wasteful.
**Action:** Always lift static lookup tables (like regex pattern arrays) outside of functions to module scope to avoid re-instantiation. Use memoization (caching) via a composite string key for functions performing repetitive, deterministic, heavy string parsing when inputs have low cardinality.

## 2024-05-20 - Dynamic Lua Compilation Bottleneck in Filter Execution
**Learning:** Calling `load()` to compile Lua strings dynamically inside high-frequency loops, such as LFG list filtering which is evaluated per-search-result, causes redundant CPU overhead and can lead to UI blocking/stuttering since the expression text usually remains constant for a given filter pass.
**Action:** Always cache the compiled function object (e.g., via simple memoization checking the expression string) when executing dynamically provided expressions over collections.
